Floorplan and interior plan for Helsinki Hacklab premises at Takkatie.


NOTE: Use sketchup version 2008!  So far it seems to be the latest one to work on linux(with wine), mac, and windows.

Model larger furniture and ensembles as separate sketchups, then use import to import them to sisustettu.skp.  
You can right click and select reload later to update an imported model.
